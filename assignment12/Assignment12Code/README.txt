Assignment 12

The DoubleArrayWritable and Utils classes I used were the ones provided in past solutions by Prof. Franke.

The arguments taken in are still the class declaration, avro input file, text input file, and output directory.
	Ex:com.refactorlabs.cs378.PriceRangeAnalysis 
           s3n://utcs378/data/dataSet12large/part-r-00000.avro 
           s3n://utcs378/data/dataSet12large/recordIdPrice.txt 
           s3n://utcs378/db25633/zAsgn12_27

Also, I believe I have correctly implemented my solution to be considered for the extra credit.
